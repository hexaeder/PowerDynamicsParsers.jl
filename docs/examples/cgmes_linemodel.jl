# Line model calculation

The goal of this example is to create line models for relatively simple lines
(single ACLineSegment branch) and check if their results match the power flow.
=#
using PowerDynamics
using PowerDynamicsParsers
using PowerDynamicsParsers.CGMES
dataset1 = CIMDataset(joinpath(pkgdir(PowerDynamicsParsers), "test", "CGMES", "data", "1-EHVHV-mixed-all-2-sw-Ausschnitt"))
nodes, edges = split_topologically(dataset1; warn=false)
nothing #hide
#=
In this second dataset, the first line is an ACLineSegment with two terminals.
We go ahead and try to build a Power Dynamics line model for it:
=#
em = CGMES.get_edge_model(edges[2])

#=
I wrote a small function that takes the voltage steady state from the surrounding voltage nodes,
calculates the power at both ends of the line model, and compares it to the power flow result
stored in the CGMES dataset (i.e., the power through the terminals at both ends).
=#
CGMES.test_powerflow(em)
#=
However, the results do not match!
For debugging, I implemented another function: given the voltages and powers at both ends,
this function tries to calculate the correct R, X, G, B parameters for a pi-line model.
=#
CGMES.determine_branch_parameters(edges[2])
#=
We see that the R and X values are different from the calculated ones. If we use the calculated
variables instead, the power flow result matches the values from the dataset:
=#
set_default!(em, :ACLineSegment₊R, 0.00669677741911068)
set_default!(em, :ACLineSegment₊X, 0.005344772670911904)
CGMES.test_powerflow(em)

#=
At first, I thought this was due to some base calculation or some other parameter mismatch.
However, let's take the dataset I got first:
=#
dataset2 = CIMDataset(joinpath(pkgdir(PowerDynamicsParsers), "test", "CGMES", "data", "testdata1"))
nodes, edges = split_topologically(dataset2; warn=false)
nothing # hide

#=
Here, we have 3 power lines and each of them is just a pi-line. So we can check again:

**Power line 1:**
=#
em = CGMES.get_edge_model(edges[1])
#-
CGMES.test_powerflow(em)
#=
**Power line 2:**
=#
em = CGMES.get_edge_model(edges[2])
CGMES.test_powerflow(em)
#=
**Power line 3:**
=#
em = CGMES.get_edge_model(edges[3])
CGMES.test_powerflow(em)

#=
For this model, the backward calculation of R, X, G, and B can be validated too:
=#
CGMES.determine_branch_parameters(edges[3])
#=
This confirms the results.

!!! danger "Error in the CGMES Data?"
    In conclusion, it looks like the CGMES data is not consistent in the newer dataset! Either
    the branch parameters are wrong, or the power flow results are wrong.
